# Bot Forecaster Configurations
# Each bot has a username and a strategy configuration
#
# Strategy format:
#   strategies:
#     - metric: 'total_points' (or any Statistic type: assists, goals_scored, minutes, etc.)
#       weight: 1.0 (relative weight of this metric)
#       lookback: 5 (number of gameweeks to look back)
#       recency: 'none' | 'linear' | 'exponential' (how to weight recent gameweeks)
#
# Available metrics: total_points, goals_scored, assists, minutes, bonus, ict_index,
#                    influence, creativity, threat, expected_goals, expected_assists, etc.
#
# Empty config {} defaults to random selection
